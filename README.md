# Python-based Basic Image Editing Application

This is a personal project borne out of my interest in photography. It aims to emulate a rudimentary version of Lightroom.
The app has a simple GUI, launched from terminal.

Functions:
1. Add Gaussian Blur
2. Change Brightness and Contrast
3. Change individual RGB Values
4. Adjust Color Temperature
5. Crop

Additional functionalities will be added soon.

It uses the PIL, Tkinter, numpy and matplotlib modules.
